Top Pot Doughnuts Table of Hourly and Daily Simulated Demand

By Cortney Lane

This project uses HTML and JavaScript to generate a table that displays simulated hourly demand at five Top Pot locations. The number of doughnuts sold per hour is then added up into a daily total at the end of the location's table row.

In this project, I learned how to create and append table rows and table data using JavaScript by manipulating the DOM. I also learned how to create a constructor function, and use prototype functions to more efficiently save object data and generate location demand data. The number of customers per hour is a randomized number, falling somewhere between the location-specific minimum and maximum customers per hour, and totals in the table are based off of those generated numbers.
